        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>We met on Hingeâ€”yes, that dating app where you can judge someone based on their profile pictures and their ability to craft a witty bio. And what started as a casual conversation quickly turned into an hour-long discussion about our mutual love for <em>Princess Mononoke.</em></p>
        <p>Since then, from clamming on the shores of Oregon to dancing in New York at a Fujii Kaze concert, every trip has added another cherished chapter. We've crossed oceans to explore the beauty of Japan and traveled back in time by visiting each other's childhood home in China.</p>
        <p>Through every journey and every moment, we've discovered that loveâ€”like travelâ€”isn't just about the destination. It's about the stories you collect and the partner you share them with. We can't wait to continue this adventure together, and we're so grateful to have you be part of our next chapter.</p>
